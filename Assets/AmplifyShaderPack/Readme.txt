[!] Technical Considerations [!]
  
  * These shaders have been created with Unity 2019.4
  * Built-in shaders will work with any Unity version
  * Includes HDRP/URP shaders been created for SRP 7xx to 9xx and 10xx to 11xx. 
    You need Amplify Shader Editorto updated these shaders in order to make them
 	work properly with another SRP version.
  * Please note that using HDRP/URP shaders with a different SRP version without
    updating them will likely render incorrectly or show as Pink/Magenta. 
	This is expected, shaders must be open with the editor and saved to automatically
	update them to a different supported SRP version.

Troubleshooting PINK/MAGENTA shaders
  
  * Be sure that your opening the correct version of the shader, Built-in shaders 
    only work with the Built-in Renderer, URP with the Universal Renderer, and HDRP
    with the High Definition Renderer.
  * When using URP/HDRP, check your Unity and SRP version, make sure that you have the 
	correct shader pack version imported. 
  * Open and save to update a shader your specific(compatible) SRP version.
